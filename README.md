# Customer Segmentation Analysis
In this project, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of an e-commerce dataset to perform customer segmentation through advanced clustering techniques. The main objective of customer segmentation is to enable businesses to gain deeper insights into their customers, facilitating the development of targeted marketing and engagement strategies based on customer behavior.

Leveraging the K-Means clustering algorithm, we successfully grouped customers based on three key factors: total sales, recency of purchase, and frequency of purchase. This project showcases our ability to utilize machine learning and data-driven approaches to derive actionable insights that can significantly enhance business performance and optimize customer outreach.

Through our innovative analysis, we have demonstrated a strong understanding of data science techniques and their practical applications in the real world. This project is a testament to our commitment to delivering value-driven solutions to complex business challenges, making us an ideal candidate for data-driven organizations looking to improve their understanding of customer behavior and drive growth.
